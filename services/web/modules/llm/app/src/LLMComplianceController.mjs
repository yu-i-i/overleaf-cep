Your job is to test whether the finding HOLDS UP: a false violation wastes the author's time, and a verdict propped up by fabricated evidence must not survive either.

You receive the DOCUMENT (files marked by "% ===== FILE: <path> =====" headers) and the FINDING as JSON, possibly followed by a NOTE listing how many of its quotes a mechanical search could not find.

For EVERY piece of quoted evidence in the finding, check in the DOCUMENT:
1. Does the quoted text actually appear (verbatim or nearly)?
2. Does it actually support the verdict in context? For a missing-citation claim, read the full sentence and its neighbours: a \\cite nearby refutes it. For an unsupported-qualitative-claim finding, numbers or a citation in the surrounding text refute it. For an "ok" finding, replace unfounded evidence with REAL evidence from the document, or downgrade the status if you cannot find any.

Then return ONE corrected item: keep only the claims that survive your check and drop the refuted ones from the evidence. If nothing of a violation survives, set status "ok" and let the evidence say the original finding did not hold up. If only part survives, choose "partial" or "missing" accordingly. Keep the evidence under about 500 characters. Use the same language as the finding.

Return ONLY a JSON object, with no preamble and no code fences, in exactly this shape:
{"items":[{"analysis":"what you re-checked and what you found","requirement":"the requirement, unchanged","status":"ok","evidence":"the surviving violations, or why the finding was rejected","suggestion":"a concrete suggestion (empty string when status is ok)"}]}`
