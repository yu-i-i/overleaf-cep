## Community Edition

[Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com) is an open-source online real-time collaborative LaTeX editor. Overleaf runs a hosted version at [www.overleaf.com](https://www.overleaf.com), but you can also run your own local version, and contribute to the development of Overleaf.

## Extended Community Edition

The present "extended" version of Overleaf CE includes:

- LDAP authentication
- Real-time track changes and comments
- Autocomplete of reference keys
- Sandboxed compiles

## Enterprise

If you want help installing and maintaining Overleaf in your lab or workplace, Overleaf an officially supported version called [Overleaf Server Pro](https://www.overleaf.com/for/enterprises).

## Installation

Detailed installation instructions can be found in the [Overleaf Toolkit](https://github.com/overleaf/toolkit/).
To run a custom image, add a file named `docker-compose.override.yml` with the following or similar content into the `./toolkit/config` directory:

```yml
---
version: '2.2'
services:
    sharelatex:
        image: sharelatex/sharelatex:ldap-tc
```

## LDAP Configuration

Internally, Overleaf LDAP uses the [passport-ldapauth](https://github.com/vesse/passport-ldapauth) library. Most of these configuration options are passed through to the `server` config object which is used to configure `passport-ldapauth`. If you are having issues configuring LDAP, it is worth reading the README for `passport-ldapauth` to get a feel for the configuration it expects.

### Environment Variables

- `OVERLEAF_LDAP_URL` **(required)** =
    Url of the LDAP server,
    E.g., 'ldaps://ldap.example.com:636' (LDAP over SSL), 'ldap://ldap.example.com:389' (unencrypted, or LDAP over TLS).

- `OVERLEAF_LDAP_EMAIL_ATT` =
   The email attribute returned by the LDAP server, defaults to 'mail'. Each LDAP user must have at least one email address. 
   If multiple addresses are provided, only the first one will be used.

- `OVERLEAF_LDAP_FIRST_NAME_ATT` =
  The property name holding the first name of the user which is used in the application, usually 'givenName'

- `OVERLEAF_LDAP_LAST_NAME_ATT` =
  The property name holding the family name of the user which is used in the application, usually 'sn'

- `OVERLEAF_LDAP_NAME_ATT` =
  The property name holding the full name of the user, usually 'cn'. If either of the two previous variables is not defined,
  the first and/or last name of the user is extracted from this variable. Otherwise, it is not used.

- `OVERLEAF_LDAP_PLACEHOLDER` =
  The placeholder for the login form, defaults to 'Username'

- `OVERLEAF_LDAP_UPDATE_USER_DETAILS_ON_LOGIN` =
  If set to 'true', will update the LDAP user first_name and last_name field on each login, and turn off the user-details form on /user/settings
  page for LDAP users. Otherwise, details will be fetched only on first login.

- `OVERLEAF_LDAP_BIND_DN` =
   Optional. The distinguished name of the LDAP user that should be used for the LDAP connection
   (this user should be able to search/list accounts on the LDAP server),
   e.g., 'cn=ldap_reader,dc=example,dc=com'. If not defined, anonymous binding is used.

- `OVERLEAF_LDAP_BIND_CREDENTIALS` =
    Password for `OVERLEAF_LDAP_BIND_DN`.

- `OVERLEAF_LDAP_BIND_PROPERTY` =
    Optional, default 'dn'. Property of the user to bind against the client.

- `OVERLEAF_LDAP_SEARCH_BASE` **(required)** =
    The base DN from which to search for users.
     E.g., 'ou=people,dc=example,dc=com'

- `OVERLEAF_LDAP_SEARCH_FILTER` =
    LDAP search filter with which to find a user by username, e.g.,
    '(|(uid={{username}})(mail={{username}}))'. Use the literal '{{username}}' to have the
    given username be interpolated in for the LDAP search. If you are using Active Directory then the
    search filter '(sAMAccountName={{username}})' may be more appropriate.

- `OVERLEAF_LDAP_SEARCH_SCOPE` =
    Optional, default 'sub'. Scope of the search is one of 'base', 'one', or 'sub'.

- `OVERLEAF_LDAP_SEARCH_ATTRIBUTES` =
    Optional, default all. Json array of attributes to fetch from LDAP server, e.g., '["uid", "mail", "givenName", "sn"]'

- `OVERLEAF_LDAP_STARTTLS` =
    If 'true', LDAP over TLS is used.

- `OVERLEAF_LDAP_TLS_OPTS_CA_PATH` =
    A JSON array of paths to the CA file for TLS, must be accessible to the docker container.
    E.g., '["/var/one.pem", "/var/two.pem"]'

- `OVERLEAF_LDAP_TLS_OPTS_REJECT_UNAUTH` =
     If 'true', the server certificate is verified against the list of supplied CAs.

- `OVERLEAF_LDAP_CACHE` =
    Optional. If 'true', then up to 100 credentials at a time will be cached for 5 minutes.

- `OVERLEAF_LDAP_TIMEOUT` =
    Optional, default Infinity. How long the client should let
    operations live for before timing out.

- `OVERLEAF_LDAP_CONNECT_TIMEOUT` =
    Optional, default is up to the OS. How long the client should wait
    before timing out on TCP connections.

The next 5 variables are used to determine if the user has admin rights. **Please, note: the user gains admin status if the search result is not empty, not when the user is explicitly included in the search results.**

- `OVERLEAF_LDAP_ADMIN_SEARCH_BASE` =
    Optional. Specifies the base DN from which to start searching for the admin group. If this variable is defined,
    `OVERLEAF_LDAP_ADMIN_SEARCH_FILTER` must also be defined for the search to function properly.

- `OVERLEAF_LDAP_ADMIN_SEARCH_FILTER` =
    Optional. Defines the LDAP search filter used to identify the admin group. The placeholder '{{dn}}' within the filter
    is replaced with the value of the property specified by `OVERLEAF_LDAP_ADMIN_DN_PROPERTY`. The placeholder '{{username}}' is also supported.

- `OVERLEAF_LDAP_ADMIN_DN_PROPERTY` =
    Optional, defaults to 'dn'. Specifies the property of the user object that will replace the '{{dn}}' placeholder
    in the `OVERLEAF_LDAP_ADMIN_SEARCH_FILTER`.

- `OVERLEAF_LDAP_ADMIN_SEARCH_SCOPE` =
    Optional, defaults to 'sub'. The scope of the LDAP search, which can be one of 'base', 'one', or 'sub'.

- `OVERLEAF_LDAP_UPDATE_ADMIN_ON_LOGIN` =
    Optional, default 'false'. If 'true', the user's admin status is updated on each login. Otherwise, the admin status is set only on the first login.


#### Example:

In the following example admins are members of a group 'admins', the objectClass of the entry 'admins' is 'groupOfNames':

    OVERLEAF_LDAP_ADMIN_SEARCH_BASE='cn=admins,ou=group,dc=example,dc=com'
    OVERLEAF_LDAP_ADMIN_SEARCH_FILTER='(member={{dn}})'

In the following example admins are members of a group 'admins', the objectClass of the entry 'admins' is 'posixGroup':

    OVERLEAF_LDAP_ADMIN_SEARCH_BASE='cn=admins,ou=group,dc=example,dc=com'
    OVERLEAF_LDAP_ADMIN_SEARCH_FILTER='(memberUid={{username}})'

In the following example admins are users with UNIX gid=1234:

    OVERLEAF_LDAP_ADMIN_SEARCH_BASE='ou=people,dc=example,dc=com'
    OVERLEAF_LDAP_ADMIN_SEARCH_FILTER='(&(gidNumber=1234)(uid={{username}}))'

In the following example admin is the user with uid=someuser:

    OVERLEAF_LDAP_ADMIN_SEARCH_BASE='ou=people,dc=example,dc=com'
    OVERLEAF_LDAP_ADMIN_SEARCH_FILTER='(&(uid=someuser)(uid={{username}}))'

The filter

    OVERLEAF_LDAP_ADMIN_SEARCH_FILTER='(uid=someuser)'

where 'someuser' is the uid of an existing user, will always produce a non-empty search result. 
As a result, **every user will be granted admin rights**, not just 'someuser', as one might expect.


The next 5 variables are used to configure how user contacts are retrieved from the LDAP server.

- `OVERLEAF_LDAP_CONTACTS_SEARCH_BASE` =
    Optional. Specifies the base DN from which to start searching for the contacts. Defauls to `OVERLEAF_LDAP_SEARCH_BASE`.

- `OVERLEAF_LDAP_CONTACTS_SEARCH_SCOPE` =
    Optional, default 'sub'. Scope of the search is one of 'base', 'one', or 'sub'.

- `OVERLEAF_LDAP_CONTACTS_FILTER` =
    Optional. The filter used to search for users in the LDAP server to be loaded into contacts. The placeholder '{{userProperty}}' within the filter is replaced with the value of
    the property specified by `OVERLEAF_LDAP_CONTACTS_PROPERTY` from the LDAP user initiating the search. If not defined, no users are retrieved from the LDAP server into contacts.

- `OVERLEAF_LDAP_CONTACTS_PROPERTY` =
    Optional. Specifies the property of the user object that will replace the '{{userProperty}}' placeholder in the `OVERLEAF_LDAP_CONTACTS_FILTER`.

- `OVERLEAF_LDAP_CONTACTS_NON_LDAP_VALUE` =
    Optional. Specifies the value of the `OVERLEAF_LDAP_CONTACTS_PROPERTY` if the search is initiated by a non-LDAP user. If this variable is not defined, the resulting filter
    will match nothing. The value '*' can be used as a wildcard.

#### Example:

    OVERLEAF_LDAP_CONTACTS_FILTER=(gidNumber={{userProperty}})
    OVERLEAF_LDAP_CONTACTS_PROPERTY=gidNumber
    OVERLEAF_LDAP_CONTACTS_NON_LDAP_VALUE=1000

The above example results in loading into the contacts of the current LDAP user all LDAP users who have the same UNIX gid. Non-LDAP users will have all LDAP users with UNIX gid=1000 in their contacts.

## Sandboxed Compiles

To enable sandboxed compiles, edit `docker-compose.override.yml` to include the following `volumes` and `environment` configuration options.

```yml
---
version: '2.2'
services:
    sharelatex:
        image: sharelatex/sharelatex:ldap-tc

    volumes:
      "${DOCKER_SOCKET_PATH}": "/var/run/docker.sock"
    
    environment:
      DOCKER_RUNNER: 'true'
      SANDBOXED_COMPILES: 'true'
      SANDBOXED_COMPILES_SIBLING_CONTAINERS: 'true'
      SANDBOXED_COMPILES_HOST_DIR: "${OVERLEAF_DATA_PATH}/data/compiles"
      SYNCTEX_BIN_HOST_PATH: "${OVERLEAF_DATA_PATH}/bin/synctex"
      TEXLIVE_IMAGE: "texlive/texlive:latest-full"
      TEX_LIVE_DOCKER_IMAGE: "texlive/texlive:latest-full"
```

Edit `overleaf-toolkit/config/overleaf.rc` to set the following configuration options to an appropriate value for your host machine.

```text
# Sibling Containers
# The following option is in comments to silence a built-in warning, will be enabled differently
# SIBLING_CONTAINERS_ENABLED=true
DOCKER_SOCKET_PATH=/var/run/docker.sock
```

Note that `SIBLING_CONTAINERS_ENABLED` is commented out to silence the following warning that Overleaf prints at startup (the option is set in the docker-compose file instead):

> WARNING: SIBLING_CONTAINERS_ENABLED=true is not supported in Overleaf Community Edition.
>   Sibling containers are not available in Community Edition, which is intended for use in environments where all users are trusted. Community Edition is not appropriate for scenarios where isolation of users is required.
>   When not using Sibling containers, users have full read and write access to the 'sharelatex' container resources (filesystem, network, environment variables) when running LaTeX compiles.
>   Sibling containers are offered as part of our Server Pro offering and you can read more about the differences at https://www.overleaf.com/for/enterprises/features.
>   Falling back using insecure in-container compiles. Set SIBLING_CONTAINERS_ENABLED=false in config/overleaf.rc to silence this warning.

The above `docker-compose.override.yml` will compile documents in a fresh docker container that uses the `texlive/texlive:latest-full` image. This image is not automatically installed, and must be available on the system. Before starting overleaf, you can make it available on the host system as follows:

```sh
docker pull texlive/texlive:latest-full
```


## Overleaf Docker Image

This repo contains two dockerfiles, [`Dockerfile-base`](server-ce/Dockerfile-base), which builds the
`sharelatex/sharelatex-base` image, and [`Dockerfile`](server-ce/Dockerfile) which builds the
`sharelatex/sharelatex` (or "community") image.

The Base image generally contains the basic dependencies like `wget`, plus `texlive`.
We split this out because it's a pretty heavy set of
dependencies, and it's nice to not have to rebuild all of that every time.

The `sharelatex/sharelatex` image extends the base image and adds the actual Overleaf code
and services.

Use `make build-base` and `make build-community` from `server-ce/` to build these images.

We use the [Phusion base-image](https://github.com/phusion/baseimage-docker)
(which is extended by our `base` image) to provide us with a VM-like container
in which to run the Overleaf services. Baseimage uses the `runit` service
manager to manage services, and we add our init-scripts from the `server-ce/runit`
folder.
